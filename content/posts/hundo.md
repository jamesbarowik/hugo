## Introduction
As part of the Digital T-Level we are required to complete a minmum of 45 days work experience. For this project we worked with Leeds City Council and Hundo

Hundo's project was to provide digital work experience for Digital Students such as our selfs. So it made for a perfect opportunity to work and gain connections with external companies as well as completing 10 of our 45 days

## The Brief
Over the course of the next 5 weeks, you will work with hundo to design, build and promote a product for Leeds City Council. You will be working with the hundo team, and the Employment and Skills team from Leeds City Council.

## Product Requirements
Leeds City Council had an idea and they wanted to make an emmersive experience that showcased all the exhibitors that visted Leeds Apprenticeship Requirement Fair 2024 into and online experience so that people that went able to travel into the centre of leeds for the face to face event. Also that users we're able to access all the information that they needed if they were interested in applying for an apprenticship

## My Role
During the project we were split into groups to tackle the project and make it more manageable and organised so that we could work independantly and get the tasks done

We were given a Google Drive with all of them employers and a spreadsheet with there information. Firstly we made sure that all of our assets were in the correct format and were right for the spatial program that we used once we had made sure that all of the assets followed the quide lines we started adding them into the world. WSe made sure that all the assets were spaced out roughly to make sure that the space was clear and everything was easy to view for all the people that were involved

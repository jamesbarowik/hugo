Talking about my time at Brandon Medical on Work Experience

<!--more-->

## Introduction

Brandon Medical is a world-leading designer and manufacturer of capital medical equipment for operating theatres, critical care areas and primary care. Over the last 3 months I was fortunate enough to complete a work placement experience at Brandon Medical, during my time at Brandon I was creating an eLearning Site for the staff to be able to learn about the products that they sell.

## Application Process

When we were given the job listings in November and we were given a timeline to create and produce our CV and Cover Letter for the companies that we wanted to apply for, I read and checked the business that were offering placements, we had companies like Asda, Hippo Digital, Brandon Medical, Leeds City Council, Rodillian Academy. Brandon had immediately stuck out to me as there was a task set. Brandon had set out that they wanted to create a Moodle site for Staff eLearning. 

As we have got the servers that were available at college I had tested and checked moodle out before applying. With the small bit of work that I did with Moodle it seemed like something that would be interesting.

## Daily / Weekly Tasks

On a day to day basis I was communicating with the HR Manager as I worked closely with her to create the eLearning Platform. I was also working closely with other department leads such as the Marketing Director, and the Research and Development Lead to ensure that the material that we were uploading and updating was accurate and relevant. I was regularly meeting the CEO to give him progres updates as he is one of the members of the team that was giving me content to add to moodle. During my time I also created user documentation which was harder than I first imagined as I had to think about telling people to use a system that I already knew how to use which wasn’t as easy as I had first thought.

## Skills I’ve gained

* As silly as it sounds, my time at Brandon really helped me learn how to make effective notes during meetings and whilst talking to people in general. When there are 10 \- 15 people in a meeting it's very hard to digest everything that has been said but being able to take notes and write down things in an effective manner is one of the best things that i've learned to this day.  
* Another thing that sounds silly but it's very simple is writing an email that is short, precise and to the point, Nobody wants to be reading a 200 word email for the information to be right at the bottom or not even in there at all so learning that is a really good skill too.

## Summary

I really enjoyed my time at Brandon and it was a very nice feeling to be treated as an adult instead of a student that was just there on work placement. I actually felt part of the team.

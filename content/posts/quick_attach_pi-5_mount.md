Creation of the New Quick Attach Vesa Mount for the Raspberry Pi-5
<!--more-->
## Installation
When we first got the set of Raspberry Pi 5 that we have at college as part of the T-Level Digital Department they were just sitting on the table they kept getting knocked off and kept getting disconnected whilst people were using them which was a huge pain. So to solve that problem we first found a 3D Model that someone had pre-made on Thingiverse and printed 17 of those. The only problem with it was we need to remove the entire mount to move the Raspberry Pi or to even do anything with them. So I decided it was time after a push from my Tutor to create a new one that allowed for the Piâ€™s to be mounted where they were still secure but allowed for them to be moved quite easily if there was a repair or a simple fix that needed doing.

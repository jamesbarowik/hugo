I looked into creating a bash script, that would automate the process as much as possible to reduce the amount of time that it took to setup and install all of the machines. Something that I would like to look into in the future is the addition of a deployment server that install the OS automatically across the network of machines. I currently have no idea how I’d go about doing that so using a bash based automated process.\nI checked around for other examples of bash scripting and bash found similar things to what I was doing, The first time I tried to do this I had the files on a USB Stick which was a lot slower as the file transfer was much slower than the internet speed.\nI made sure that i added a .gitignore to remove and files that weren\u0026rsquo;t required during the running of the script, this is to reduce the size of the repo to increase the cloning speed to setup the initial script and ensure that everything is running correctly.\nI also added the local-downloads folder to ensure that any files that were downloaded or creating during to script running were in the local-downloads folder and were removed after as to reduce machine lag and free space on the drive for the users\nThe script firstly remove software;\nQT Transmission Remmina Gnome Snapshot Rythmbox The script installs software;\nthonny pandas (python library) Chromium Browser Okular Git GitHub Desktop PhpStorm Project Libre apache php sssd-ad sssd-tools realmd adcli Commands These are a few of the basic commands that i used with a brief notes about what they do, from a very basic understanding\napt sudo apt update\rsudo apt upgrade Basic package manager for debian based systems, I opted to change this out for an expanded and quicker manager called nala that can be up to 16x faster then APT.\nwget sudo wget \u0026#34;https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/releases/download/2.18.1/fastfetch-linux-amd64.deb\u0026#34; The wget command is used to download a file from a web server and download it to the local drive, this is much quicker than using the USB stick to download the files.\nnmcli sudo nmcli connection modify \u0026#39;tlevel-digital\u0026#39; ipv4.dns \u0026#34;172.16.0.4 8.8.8.8\u0026#34;\rsudo nmcli connection modify \u0026#39;tlevel-digital\u0026#39; ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes The use of the Network Manager CLI to automate the process of the DNS Server to ensure, The initial idea of this would have been to have it hand it out via DHCP, But the AP that we had doesn\u0026rsquo;t support the altering of the DHCP Pool without an addon that was more than what we required so we opted to manually get it up instead.\ngrep nmcli connection show tlevel-digital | grep ipv4.dns: The connections show listed all the information about the selected network, the addition of grep was to filter the output as there was lots of additional information that isn\u0026rsquo;t required for the setup of these machines, as they aren\u0026rsquo;t required to have a statically assigned to each machine.\ndpkg sudo dpkg -i projectlibre_1.9.3-1.deb dpkg is a Debian based command line tool to install .deb files on the system this is used for a few of the packages that have been installed.\nFile Types .desktop [Desktop Entry]\rVersion=1.0\rType=Application\rTerminal=false\rExec=/opt/PhpStorm/bin/phpstorm.sh\rName=PhpStorm\rComment=Jetbrains PHP IDE\rIcon=/opt/PhpStorm/bin/phpstorm.png A .desktop file is the way that you are supposed to add new applications to the gnome start menu as the Machines are using Ubuntu, it is important for users that are too familiar with linux to be able to use the start menu to open and locate common software. The example that was shown above is for PhpStorm, another features that I am in the middle of implementing is phpmyAdmin so that the users are able to select the phpmyAdmin site without needing to know the IP address of the server that is running phpmyAdmin as we aren\u0026rsquo;t running that locally on the Pi\u0026rsquo;s as they aren\u0026rsquo;t that powerful. The post will be updated in the future to add more and more features that I have added.\nFinal Script https://github.com/SilentSmeary/rpi-bash\rUsage git clone https://github.com/silentsmeary/rpi-bash cd rpi-bash ./setup.sh ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/rpi5-bash/","tags":null,"title":"Raspberry Pi Bash Project"},{"categories":["Cisco","Networking"],"content":"Pre-Information The code below in the configuration for a Cisco 1921 with a class C Network where the router has been given the IP address 172.16.0.1.

We initial met with them in person and spoke with Dan that was our a lead contact at Smartsearch and the team. We also met with David who is one of the software developers at SmartSearch he assisted along the way with more of the team management to ensure that we were on the right tracks and that we made a viable product at the end that could be used to bring people to the SmartSearch stand and get them interetsed.\nAfter the first meeting When we first met in person we decided that it would be best if we had weekly meetings to ensure contact with Dan and the team. This ment that we could share progress, showcasing the work that we had done. In the first week we were tasked with creating a mood board of ideas for games that we could create and games that we would like to make that fit the initial ideas that we were given.\nWe came up with:\nMaze game with fog of war Pre-Built Maze: Allows the designer to create a maze they know is simple and easy to navigate. Change the items spawns around but users must find all the items then exit. Allows for user to easily navigate with a controller Random Maze: Maze is randomised each run of the game. Users must still find the items in the maze before being able to leave. Performing their \u0026ldquo;Smart Search\u0026rdquo; Users must naviagte a maze with little light in order to find items before making their escape Map can be preset with randomised items, locations and dangers Map can be random as well as the items (harder to randomise the map though) Identify Game This game is all about picking out the dangers in each \u0026ldquo;line up\u0026rdquo; of characters. A downside is that this game would be much more suited to being played with the mouse as moving a cursor with a joystick could feel bad especially for high skill players. Players have to identify the suspisious character from a description (which is generated by the items picked to make them up) but all the characters are close thst its not easy. Scoring could be done in several ways: How fast you can find the odd one out, how many you can find withing a set time, probably more. Leadboards and Main Menus All the games lend themselves to Leader boards for either time or score Can be stored locally on the machine and expanded to be in / on the website where it is hosted (though this would be more difficult) Allows options for \u0026ldquo;daily\u0026rdquo; leader board and All time leaderboard to be created. Easy to animate the menu and include a high score board as well We presented all the ideas to the smartsearch team and left them with our thoughts. In the end Smartsearch came to the conclusion that they liked the \u0026ldquo;Maze game with fog of war.\u0026rdquo;\nFirst Development Steps We needed to find a platform that ment we could share code with each other without the requirement to install tonnes of software that could cause issues for others that don\u0026rsquo;t have powerful computers at home. The conclusion for this was to use GitHub it ment that we could share the code. We also needed a solution for the team management for this time we tried GitHub projects but I think the next time I work on a project I would rather use Trello which is similar but has more advanced features when working with others.\nDevelopment We cotinuted the development for around 12 weeks, we had weekly meeting with Dan and David to share the progress and get reports on what we need to work on for next week. We aimed to have the game working before the launch day. On this instance we did not meet that requirement but we just had a few small things that needed to be changed there were mostly backend features. But we got those features added the morning of the launch. Making sure that we moved all the test machines to the correct build.\nLaunch Day On April 29th we launched the smartsearch project we met with:\nMartin Cheek (MD of Smartsearch) Andrew Booth (VP of Technology) Vicky Hester (Head of Talent Management) Dan Jackson (Talent Management) David Moftakhar (Software Developer) We presented a small PowerPoint where each member of the team choose what part they wanted to speak about. They choose parts that they were most involved in, As my expertise where with GitHub and the hosting of the files and the website I spoke about why we used Github and the future plans for the game to make it more future proof.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/smartsearch/","tags":null,"title":"Smartsearch Game"},{"categories":["Linux","Servers","Networking","KVM","Virtual Machines"],"content":"Introduction Firstly, we installed Windows Server 2019 on the bare metal. As I wanted to learn more skills related to infrastructure it was essential that I could learn linux skills as well as windows skills. So, I spent a few days looking around at other solutions that ment I was able to learn more with the hardware and I stumbled across Proxmox.\nProxmox is a free and open source solution to virutalisation that allows for the creation of virtual machines using any operating system. Which ment we could host our Active Directory Service, Aswell as the networked storage solution that we use TrueNAS Scale.\nInstallation The installation was very easy as the Graphical Installer was very simple and needed the basic amount of information to install fully. I made sure to give the server a Static IP as if it used a DHCP IP the lease could end and it might not be given the same IP. Meaning that the server is inaccessible\nVM\u0026rsquo;s We used Windows Server 2019 as it worked with the bare metal hardware to make sure that I didn\u0026rsquo;t run into any issues later. We need to use windows for the Active Directory to authenticate users.\nWe need a central server for storing files to ensure that users aren\u0026rsquo;t storing files on there Local Machines incase Machines were re-imaged and users didn\u0026rsquo;t backup there files to the cloud.

For this project we worked with Leeds City Council and Hundo\nHundo\u0026rsquo;s project was to provide digital work experience for Digital Students such as our selfs. So it made for a perfect opportunity to work and gain connections with external companies as well as completing 10 of our 45 days\nThe Brief Over the course of the next 5 weeks, you will work with hundo to design, build and promote a product for Leeds City Council. You will be working with the hundo team, and the Employment and Skills team from Leeds City Council.\nProduct Requirements Leeds City Council had an idea and they wanted to make an emmersive experience that showcased all the exhibitors that visted Leeds Apprenticeship Requirement Fair 2024 into and online experience so that people that went able to travel into the centre of leeds for the face to face event. Also that users we\u0026rsquo;re able to access all the information that they needed if they were interested in applying for an apprenticship\nMy Role During the project we were split into groups to tackle the project and make it more manageable and organised so that we could work independantly and get the tasks done\nWe were given a Google Drive with all of them employers and a spreadsheet with there information. Firstly we made sure that all of our assets were in the correct format and were right for the spatial program that we used once we had made sure that all of the assets followed the quide lines we started adding them into the world.

We need a solution that supported both Windows Shares (SMB) and Linux Shares. With the requirements that we need and the hardware that we have the search began. For the OS that was compatible with our older hardware and that worked with never drives that were harvested from our old college machines that were no longer in use.\nFinal Choice After a few days searching and countless failed attempts to deploy a working server we found TrueNAS Scale and Core. After looking into the documentation for both of them. We found that it was not viable for use TrueNAS Scale as it ment we needed two boot drives this would have made the machines more redundant incase of a drive failure. For a long term solution this would have been much more viable. But we didnt not have the drive bays aviable for the space that we wanted. As the server only had 6 bays we decided to go for the TrueNAS Core which required us to have one boot drive. Which was perfect for our situation.\nHardware Specs The server chasis is a Fujitsu RX300 S7. On the front of the server there are 6 SATA ports in the front of the server. That are connect with a SAS connected to the PCIE Raid Card on the motherboard. The server has two CPUs both Intel Xeon E5-2620 with 12 cores and 24 threads. We decided to make the server have as much memory as we had available this was to make sure that we were able to set the RAM and the primary cache so that the drives could handle the max efficenty psible and always be running and handling data the fastest possible speed. 192GB DDR3 1066 mhz memory.\nInstallation Process For more information about installation https://www.truenas.com/docs/\rThe installation process was mostly normal there was no major hickups with the installation. Once the OS was installed the first hurdle was fighting with the network card. I wanted to make sure that we had the fastest Network Card to make sure that users were able to upload larger files at the the same time and not stress the network attempting the tasks. The servers came with the added network card by standard when they arrvied. We had the 2 ports that were standard to the motherboard, there was then two ports that were added with one of the extra network cards. We had another network card that added four more ports. There was one more network card that added two SFP ports. that we were not set up to use effectively so I decided to take that extra card out of the server to reduce the slots that showed up on there already. From there it was configurating the network, I had assigned the Static IP to the required port and made sure that the port was given the network by checking the network link lights on the network card. They were both flashing to indicate that the network was connected and authenticated. I attempted to connect to the website and recived the first error of the day. The IP was inaccessable. From there we spent some timeW attempting to fix the network errors with no outcome we decided that the best choice was to setup a DHCP pool on our VLAN to get DHCP to hand out and IP to give us the correct networking information, which allowed for straight connection. This allowed for us to make the connection and then change the IP on the socket to be a Static IP to make deployment much easier\nStorage Drives 1x 240GB Kingston SSD [BOOT] 5x 480GB Kingston SSD [STORAGE] Our goal was to have two storage clusters. One that was for the private share and the other that was the public share. In the first server that we deployed we completed this and made two addressable storage drives.\nThe private share that had a little bit over 1.2TB of space, and the Public Share that had 880GB of space.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/truenas/","tags":null,"title":"TrueNAS Scale"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]

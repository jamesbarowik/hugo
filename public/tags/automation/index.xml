      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;headerLink&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34; class=&#34;header-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to learn linux for the longest time but never really got the opportunity as in a learning situation Windows was the operating system that was used, then same for the work placement. Which ment I got really comfortable using the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux was something that interetsted me from the first time that I had looked into it as it was different from everthing else that I&amp;rsquo;d use before. I have previously used Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and am currently writing this from a Windows 11 machine. I would be daily driving linux on my Main Machine but there was some issues related to the graphics card that made it nearly impossible for that to happen&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;headerLink&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34; class=&#34;header-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further my career and learning, and the installation of the Raspberry Pi Cluster. I looked into creating a bash script, that would automate the process as much as possible to reduce the amount of time that it took to setup and install all of the machines. Something that I would like to look into in the future is the addition of a deployment server that install the OS automatically across the network of machines. I currently have no idea how Iâ€™d go about doing that so using a bash based automated process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
